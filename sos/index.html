<p class="bluetext">Two years ago, I noticed that people from the entire world can talk to me from any distance, like telepathy. 
    If you know what I am talking about, please keep reading until the end.
    Please find someone trustworthy to confirm everything below if necessary. <b><p class="pinktext">You can save a few human lives, trust me.</b></p>
<p class="bluetext">
    Don't trust any family member of mine, they will lie to you that I'm fine, 
    so they can keep doing the same shit over and over again.

    I've become some sort of meme after a hard breakup that was overshared around as gossip. 
    Now I want to expose this situation since I'm pretty sure there are friends of mine suffering 
    and we just don't know how to deal with this.

    If you were able to understand this and you have any suggestions on how to deal 
    with this situation or who we can ask for help, please reach me:<br>

    I am being tortured, and I am not the only one in my social circle.
    They reach me while I am inside my room so they can torture me. Sometimes they use that as a way of giving orders and taking control of my life.
    </p>

    <p class="bluetext">
    I'm afraid that some female friends of mine from the past are going
    through the same and they even blackmail them so they can sexually harass them. They also mess with your head and manipulate you to shut up about everything, and they show fear every time I overshare that.
    </p>

    <p class="pinktext">
    In the past 2 years, a lot of people tried to harm me in different ways, since my personal information became public after a hard breakup that was overshared around as gossip.
    </p>

    <p class="bluetext">
    Some people have created so much resentment that they have gone far beyond what a normal human being should go for because of that, using vengeance as an excuse. From harmless jokes to burning your image in front of others to actual homicide attempts, I am slowly updating this document with everything that I have about them since I am not the only one suffering because of these people.

    <h1>The sexual harassment situation</h1>
    <p class="bluetext">
    Some people reach me every day asking me to touch myself or join me in the bath to say shit to me. They also dirty talk and do other shit while I am sleeping, and expose female friends of mine while doing that, using
    their names and exposing their life in the middle of this.
    <hr></p>
    <h1>My main concern</h1>
    <p class="bluetext">
    They can make me unable to think, <b>by applying a weird amount of pressure on different parts of my skull.</b> Mainly on the back of my neck. I can't work and even basic day-to-day tasks seem impossible sometimes. From eating to sleeping right.

    They also use this shitty version of me as an argument, since I am under this kind of pressure I act crazy in front of people, friends of mine can't recognize me anymore and get involved in the middle of this crossfire.

    They make me unable to think, it got to the point of involving my daughter and also putting friends of mine in danger, and even involving drug dealers. Some people know the truth but are just afraid to talk about it since it comes to this point.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h1>The fake image in front of people's situation</h1>
    <p class="bluetext">
    They take personal information of mine, such as WhatsApp and Instagram conversations, and then they take actions based on that to assure me that I will never be able to reach or befriend anyone. Those people usually also get involved in all of this. They lie about me and overshare stories of mine from the past to scare people, so I will never be able to escape from the isolation that they've created.
    <hr></p>
    <h1>The sleeping situation</h1>
    <p class="bluetext">
    They reach me while I sleep every single night, each person for a specific purpose.  They talk to me and I answer them in a sub-conscious way while I sleep, they use that to do jokes, to ask me intimate questions just for fun, and also to manipulate me by suggesting actions repeatedly to change my mind about people around me, to turn myself against my daughter and even to ask me for money. Most of my female friends are scared by this because they get involved in the disgusting dirty talk and manipulation they usually do since they use their real names when they do that. All of these people blame me since that happening and they are aware, and they want me dead.
