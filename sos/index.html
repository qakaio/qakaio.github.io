2 years ago, I noticed that people from the entire world can talk to me. 
They can reach you from any distance, mainly my family. The number of people started to increase, I was
able to talk to a lot of famous people because of this and I've became some sort of meme. 
Some time after a lot of crazy shit started to happen because of this.
</pre>
<br>
<pre class="centertxt bluetxt regulartxt">
If you try to reach me probabaly someone will lie to you that I'm fine, so they can keep doing the same shit over and over again.
I am being torured, and I am not the only one in my social circle.
They reach me while I am inside my room, so they can torture me. Sometimes they use that as a way
of giving orders, I'm afraid for some female friends of mine from the past, since they can blackmail them using 
pain so they can sexual harass them. They also mess with your head and manipulate you.

<pre class="centertxt bluetxt regulartxt">
In the past 2 years, a lot of people tried to harm me in different ways, since personal information
of mine became public after a hard breakup that was spread around by people around. Some people have 
created so much resentment that they have gone far beyond what a normal human being should go
Since I am slowly discovering who are the ones responsible for everything going around me.
Everyone who has this sick behavior do shit, from harmless jokes to burn your image to actual homicide attempts.
I am slowly updating this document with everything that I have about them, since I am not the only suffering because of the people below.

<h1 class="title">The sexual harassment situation</h1>
<pre class="centertxt bluetxt regulartxt">
There's people who reach me everyday asking me to touch myself or join me in the bath to say shit to me.
They also dirty talk and do other shit while I am sleeping, and expose female friends of mine while doing that, using
their names and exposing their life in the middle of this.

<h1 class="title">My main concern</h1>
<pre class="centertxt bluetxt regulartxt">
They are able to make me unable to think, by applying a weird amount of pressure on different parts of my skull.
I can't work and even basic day-to-day tasks seems impossible sometimes. From eating, to sleeping right. 
They also use this version of me as an argument, since I feel high or something, I do a lot of bad choices
They make me unable to think, it got to the point of involving my daughter, putting family and friends in danger
and even involving drug dealers (who know us in real life). 
People are aware of that and don't get involved because seems to unrealistic or too dangerous for those who were able to understand everything.
</pre><br>
<h1 class="title">The fake image in front of people situation</h1>
<pre class="centertxt bluetxt regulartxt">
They literally take personal information of mine, such as whatsapp and instagram conversations for instance,
them they take actions based on that information by exposing the conversation to other people.
They lie about me and overshare stories of mine from the past to make other people fear me, and some people
who listen to those stories actually do shit to me in real life. I've not only lost some friends but also
lost respect from people I love because of exposed intimacy of mine and from my friends including old relationships.
</pre><br>
<h1 class="title">The sleeping situation</h1>
<pre class="centertxt bluetxt regulartxt">
They reach me while I sleep to talk about sex and much more. They do that every single night, each person for a specific purpose. 
They talk to me and I answer then in a sub-conscious way, they use that to do jokes, to ask me intimate questions just for fun,
and also to manipulate me by suggesing actions repeatdly to change my mind about people around me, to turn myself against my daughter
and even to ask me for money. Most of my female friends are scared by this because they get involved in the disgusting dirty talk they usually do,
since they use their real names when they do that.
