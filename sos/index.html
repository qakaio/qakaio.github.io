<h1>if someone is able to deal with this situation, please help me</h1>
<h1>I am feeling threatened again, on 11/30/2022</h1>
<h2>I started to receive death threats from several people I barely know, I don't know what it is about
But I fear for my safety. I would like to leave that someone knows how to inform themselves better if necessary, since I feel threatened
including motorcycle horns in front of my gate, in biguacu SC Rua josé angelo petit zip code 288 - 8:58 pm - 11/30/2022

So I'm posting here kinda of anomously, because they ask me to not tell anyone about my situation.
They can "reach" me, come to my house, and do a lot of weird things to me, and force me to not talk about it</h2>
<br>
<h2>I had problems with my family in the past on my mother's side, including
conflicts with my cousin Rafael and the rest of his family, a childhood argument
ended up awakening some aggressive attitudes on their part, so I try to avoid them
since then, but I believe people contacting me excessively
and that scare me for the life of me, don't have anything to do with them

<h2>My current fear is that many people have harmed in the past for personal issues,
and since I'm still okay, they are aware that I will inform someone about this "try" of homicide
and they try to silence me to keep using me and make that happen, while they still try
  to do that slowly</h2>
